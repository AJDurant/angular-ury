        <h2>Who are URY?</h2>
        <p>University Radio York (URY) is the student radio station for the University of York, broadcasting 24 hours a day during term time on 1350am across the University's Heslington Campus and worldwide via this website.</p>

        <p>The station is run <em>by students for students</em>, meaning the people behind the station understand what the listenership want to hear.</p>

        <p>With no playlist and no set format to many of our shows, our presenters have the chance to try whatever they like, as long as it's legal!</p>

        <h2>Where are URY?</h2>
        <p>URY's studios lie at the very heart of the Campus in our own building at Vanbrugh College.</p>

        <p>But URY's real presence is felt outside of the studio, around the campus at major University and Student Union events, whether we're covering live music, recruiting new Freshers or reporting on major news events.</p>
